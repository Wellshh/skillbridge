Utility Functions
=================

The chapter describes the AXL-SKILL utility functions. These include functions to derive arc center angle and radius, and to convert numeric values to different units.

### axlCheckString

`axlCheckString(t_typet_string) -> t_modString/nil`

`axlCheckString(nilnil) -> lt_types`

`axlCheckString('errornil) -> t_errorMsg/nil`

#### Description

Checks the provided string for legal characters and length. You must also provide the data type. Give this API two nils if you want to see the list of supported data types.

It performs the following checks for the data type provided:

* length check

* legal characters

For all data types except PROPVALUE, it may also modify the provided string and return the updated string to meet Allegro database rules.

* stripping leading and trailing white space

* upper case

Unique considerations by data type:

* PROPVALUE checks for common property value restrictions. Typically, a property may have more severe restrictions.

* GROUP checks for common group naming restrictions. A particular group may enforce additional restrictions.

You should use the return string since it may have been modified.

Errors messages may evolve over time. Last error is only maintained until next call to axlCheckString.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_type` | data type (nil to return all supported data types)
| `t_string` | input string
| `'error` | fetch last error message
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_modString` | Modified output string if check is successful
| `lt_types` | List of data types supported
| `nil` | Failed check
#### See Also

[axlDBControl](14dsnctl.html#690074 "14") - max name length

#### Examples

* return all supported types

> `axlCheckString(nil nil)`

* typical check

> `axlCheckString("REFDES" "u1") -> "U1"`

* error

> `axlCheckString("NET" "!GND") -> nil`

> ```
> axlCheckString('error nil)-> "ERROR(SPMHUT-1): Illegal character(s) present in the name or value."
> ```

### axlCmdList

`axlCmdList()⇒ ll_strings/nil`

#### Description

Lists commands registered by`axlCmdRegister`. The list consists of paired strings.

( (<`allegro command`> <`skill function`>)...)

#### Arguments

None.

#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `ll_strings` | List of registered Allegro PCB Editor commands paired with the related SKILL functions.

`axlCmdRegister("interboxcmd" 'axlEnterBox)`

`axlCmdList()`

`will return the following:`

`(`

`("interboxcmd" "axlEnterBox")`

`)`

### axlDebug

`axlDebug(t/nil) t/nil`

#### Description

This enables/disables AXL debug mode. See`axlIsDebug` for description of what this entails.

Enable debug also enables error messages for invalid attributes of Allegro`dbids`. This enables detecting typos when fetching data from `dbids`. This entails a slight performance hit. For example, if you have a pin `dbid`and you do a `pin->bbox` (instead of `pin->bBox`), then an error will be issued.

#### Arguments

`t` To enable AXL Skill debug mode.

`nil` To disable.

#### Values Returned

Returns last setting

**Note:** scale values much less then 1.0 may have unpredictable results.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_filename` | the name of the plot file which contains the detail.
| `point` | the location to place the detail.
| `f_scale` | the scaling factor of the details as a floating point number (1.0 is no scaling). Most be greater then 0.1

* Read history

> `axlHistory()`

> `axlHistory('read "skillhist")`

> `axlHistory()`

### axlHttp

`axlHttp(t_url)⇒ t`

#### Description

Displays a URL from Allegro PCB Editor in an external web browser. First attempts to use the last active window of a running web browser, raising the browser window to the top if required. If no browser is running, tries to start one.

On UNIX, supports only the browser, Netscape. If Netscape is not running, tries to start it. May not detect failure if the web page fails to load.

**Note:** Netscape must be in your search path.

You can override the program name using the environment variable:

`set http_netscape = <program name>`

For example:

`set http_netscape = netscape405`

**Note:** On UNIX, this function has been tested with Netscape only and may not function properly with another web browser.

On Windows, this function uses the default web browser listed in the Windows registry. If no browser is registered, this function fails. Both Netscape and Windows Explorer work with this function. You can open any file type with a Windows registry entry.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_url` | URL to display.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t` | URL displayed in web browser.
| `nil` | Failure due to web browser not being found (on UNIX), not being registered (on Windows), or being unable to load the URL.
**Note:** The function may not detect when a URL has not loaded on UNIX.

#### Examples

`axlHttp("http://www.cadence.com")`

### axlIsDebug

`axlIsDebug() ==> t/nil`

#### Description

This checks if AXL debug mode is enabled. This is associated with the`axldebug` Allegro environment variable.

When this mode is set, AXL may print additional AXL API argument warnings when arguments to AXL functions are incorrect. Many warnings do not obey this variable because they are considered serious or edge conditions. Warnings supported are less serious and are known from user feedback to be troublesome to program around.

Typically, when an AXL API function encounters an argument error, it will print a warning and return`nil`.

When unset, the code runs in development mode and eliminates many of these warnings. You should have this mode enabled when developing Skill code.

This functionality was introduced in 15.2. Currently, few AXL functions take advantage of this option.

#### Arguments

None

#### Value Returned

`t` if mode is enabled, `nil` otherwise.

#### See Also

[axlDebug](#756141 "24")

Example

`when( axlIsDebug() printf("Error\n"))`

### axlLicIsProductEnabled

`axlLicIsProductEnabled(t_license) -> t/nil`

`` axlLicIsProductEnabled(`all) -> lt_licenses ``

#### Description

Checks if license is checked-out by tool.

In first form, if given a license string returns`t` when license is checked-out and `nil` if it isn't. The test is based on the result obtained by running tool. There is no Skill method to determine licenses.

In the second form, if called with the symbol`all` returns a list of licenses currently checked out by the tool.

#### Arguments

#### Description

Converts between an MKS string to the current database user units. String can be any length name plus many common abbreviations (see`units.dat` file in the Allegro PCB Editor share/text hierarchy for supported names.)

Conversion can fail for the following reasons:

* Input string not a legal MKS format.

* Conversion will overflow the maximum allowed database size.

**Notes:**

Database is in mils.

### axlMKSAlias

`axlMKSalias(t_MKSAlias)⇒ t_alias/nil`

#### Description

Searches the MKS unit database for the current definition associated with`unitName`. Unlike `axlMKSConvert`, this function does not convert.

You load the MKS database from the following file:

> `<cds_root>/share/pcb/text/units.dat`

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_mksAlias` | Name of the alias string.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_def` | Definition name as a string.
| `nil` | Definition name could not be found.
#### Examples

`axlMKSAlias("VOLTAGE") -> "V" (Intended usage)`

`axlMKSAliaas("M") -> "METER"`

`axlMKSAlias("KG") -> NIL (The function supports only the use of basic units.)`

### axlMKSConvert

Operates in several ways, depending on the arguments passed.

* To convert a number from an input units type to an output unit type, general case:

> `axlMKSConvert (    n_input    t_inUnits    [t_outUnits]    )=> f_output/nil`

* To convert a number from an input units type to MKS units:

> `axlMKSConvert (    n_input    t_inUnits    nil    )=> f_output/nil`

* To convert a number from MKS units to an output unit type:

> `axlMKSConvert (    n_input    nil    t_outUnits    )=> f_output/nil`

* To convert an MKS string to an output units, i.e. ".5 MILS" to "INCHES":

> `axlMKSConvert (    t_input    [t_outUnits]    )=> f_output/nil`

* To pre-register an input units, so that subsequent calls need not specify units:

> `axlMKSConvert (    nil    t_inUnits    )=> t/nil`

* To convert a unit from a pre-registered input units:

> `axlMKSConvert (    n_input    ) => f_output/nil`

**Description**

Converts any allowable unit to any other allowable unit. It operates in several ways, depending on the arguments.

In all instances with`t_outUnits` as an argument, if that argument is omitted, the function converts to active design units.

* If the first argument is a number and the second argument is evaluated as the units of that number, the number is converted to the units specified by the third argument.

> A special case is if first argument is a number, the second is "design" and the third is a length unit then the input number is converted from current design units to specified length units.

* In the case where the first argument is a string, that string must be a fully instantiated units string, i.e. "15 MILS". In this case the second string is interpreted as the output units, and the value of the first string is converted to these units.

* If the first argument is nil, then the input units specified by the second argument is remembered for the future calls. The output units will default to the active design, and the function will fail as above if no design is active. Note that pre-registration will not work if there is no active design.

* When only a number is specified, the function will confirm that an input unit has been pre-registered, and will convert that number, in the pre- registered units, to the design units. Function will issue a warning and return nil if no pre-registered input units, or no active design

* When the second and third arguments are present but one is nil, it represents MKS standard units for the input or output units, respectively.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `n_input` | Number to convert
| `t_inUnits` | String giving the units of the input number. If first argument is not specified, this string should specify the input number to convert and its units.
| `t_outUnits` | String giving the new units for`f_output`. If `t_outUnits` is `nil`, converts the number to the current units of the layout.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `f_output` | Converted value of`n_input`.
| `nil` | Failed to convert value due to incorrect arguments.
#### Examples

* Typical use, convert from design units to another type (design is in mils)

> `axlMKSConvert(.5 "design" "INCHES") => 0.0005`

> `axlMKSConvert(".5 MILS" "INCHES") => 0.0005`

* Pre-register a unit type then use if on future conversions

> `axlMKSConvert(nil "MILS") => t`

> `axlMKSConvert(.5) => 0.0005`

* Go to default output conversion (METERS)

> `axlMKSConvert(.5 "MILS" nil) => 2.54e-05`

* Not just length is supported (go to farads)

> `axlMKSConvert(1e-09 nil "pF") => 1000.0`

### axlMKSStr2UU

`axlMKSStr2UU(t_String)⇒ t_mksString/nil`

#### Description

Converts an input string to a MKS string in current database units. If the input string is in MKS units, that is used as the basis for the conversion. If the string has no units, the function uses the default database units for the string.

Conversion may fail for the following reasons:

* Input string is not a legal MKS format.

* Conversion overflows the maximum database size allowed.

**Notes:**

* Conversion between metric and english units may result in rounding.

* Number returned is rounded to the database precision.

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_String` | Input string.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_mksString` | MKS string in current database units.
| `nil` | Failed to convert input string. See earlier Description for possible reasons.
#### Example

`axlMKSStr2UU("100.1") -> "100.0 MILS"`

Default conversion with the database in mils.

### axlMapClassName

`axlMapClassName(t_oldName/lt_oldName[g_mapToPCB])⇒ t_newName/lt_newName`

#### Description

Use this function to write a SKILL program that runs in Allegro PCB Editor and APD. You can map from class names to the name appropriate to the program running your SKILL program. For example, you can write a program using Allegro PCB Editor class names and have the program run in APD.

The table shows the name mapping between Allegro PCB Editor and APD.

#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `x_size` | Estimate of memory use in bytes.
### axlOSBackSlash

`axlOSBackSlash(t_directory)==> t_directory/nil`

#### Description

This changes UNIX style forward slashes to DOS style backslashes. While most applications support either style, certain older Windows applications only support DOS style path.

The UNIX style is more amenable to Skill programming.

On UNIX this just returns the incoming string.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_directory` | String containing directory path with forward slashes
#### Value Returned

`t_directory/nil`

#### See Also

### axlOSControl

`axlOSControl(s_name[g_value])==> g_currentValue/ls_names`

#### Description

Inquires and/or sets the value dealing with the graphics. If setting a value, the return is the old value of the control.

A side effect of most of these controls is if a form is active that is displaying the current setting it may not be updated. Additional side effects of individual controls, currently supported, are listed in the following table.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

#### Description

Reports time from a NTP server.

If the value of`s_mode` is set to `'name`, then Allegro PCB Editor reports the default NTP server, obtained using the environment variable NTPSERVER. Default is `0.pool.ntp.org`.

Currently, the`axlOSNtp` command uses a timeout of 50 milliseconds.

On Linux, you can query NTP time using the following command.

> `/usr/sbin/ntpdate -q <hostname>`

**Note:** IPv6 networks not supported.

* ***Must be connected to Internet and, if a firewall is enable, it must be configured to allow port 123.***

`axlPPrint("ETCH/TOP") -> "Etch/Top"`

### axlPdfView

`axlPdfView(t_pdfFile)⇒ t`

#### Description

Displays a PDF file from Allegro PCB Editor. If just the filename is given, attempts to find the PDF file using Allegro PCB Editor's`PDFPATH` variable. Displays the PDF file in an external PDF viewer.

On UNIX, the only supported PDF viewer is Acroread. The program, Acroread, must be in your`PATH`.

On Windows, uses the default PDF viewer registered with the Windows registry. If there is no registered PDF viewer, the call fails.

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_pdfFile` | Name of PDF file to display.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t` | PDF file displayed.
| `nil` | Failed to display PDF file due one of the following:  - No Acroread PDF viewer found on UNIX.  - No PDF viewer registered on Windows.
|
|
#### Example

`axlPdfView("allegro.pdf")`

### axlPrintDbid

`axlPrintDbid(o_dbid/lo_dbid[o_port]) -> t`

#### Description

This is a debug function to print one or a list of dbids. Output format is terse and parsable. This will not print all attribute data in a dbid but is customized to aid in understanding the dbid data.

`Format: <key> <attribute> <value>`

> where key can be

|  |
| --- | ---
| c | common value of attribute (objType, name, xy)
| a | other attributes
| l | printable detail on list of dbids associated with element Not all list of dbids are reported.
| g | what groups have the object.  Format:  `g group <type> name= <name>`
Output is either directed to the Skill window or if port is provided written to a file.

Note using the environment variable,`pv_showelem` you can get the same data in the s*how element* command.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `o_dbid/lo_dbid` | dbid or a list of dbids
| `o_port` | option port object (from outfile)
#### Value Returned

`t`

#### See Also

[axlShowObject](#927096 "24")

#### Example

> `l = axlGetDesign()`

> `axlPrintDbid(l)`

### axlRegexpIs

`axlRegexpIs(t_exp)⇒ t/nil`

#### Description

Determines whether an environment variable expression contains Allegro PCB Editor compatible wildcard characters. Certain select-by-name functions support wildcard characters. You can test for the presence of wildcards before calling the select-by-name type of functions.

Regular expressions used by Allegro PCB Editor are more compatible with the character set allowed in the Allegro PCB Editor object names than SKILL regular expressions. Do not use to test patterns being sent to the SKILL`regexp` family of functions.

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_exp` | SKILL symbol for the environment variable name.
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t` | Expression contains Allegro PCB Editor compatible wildcards.
| `nil` | Expression does not contain Allegro PCB Editor compatible wildcards.
### axlRunBatchDBProgram

```
axlRunBatchDBProgram(t_progt_cmdFmt[?logfile    t_logfile][?startMsg    t_startMsg][?reloadDB    t/nil][?noUnload    t/nil][?silent    t/nil][?noProgress   t/nil][?warnProgram  t/nil])⇒ t/x_error
```

#### Description

Spawns batch jobs that require an open database via an abstract model. When the job completes, it prints a message and optionally reloads (`?reloadDB`) the database if successful. If the database is saved from the current active database, it uses a temporary name to avoid overwriting the database on disk.

The following options are always required (UIBatchSpawn):

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_prog` | Name of the program to run.
| `t_cmdFmt` | Command string.
The following options are optional.

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_logFile` | Name of log file that the program creates. Registers this with the log file viewlog facility if the program ends in an error. If no log file is required, do not set this option. If no extension is given, adds`.log` as the extension.
| `startMsg` | Enables a start message to display when the program starts. Defaults to the program name. If you override by providing this string, the message begins with`"Starting..."`
| `reloadDB` | If you set this to`t`, the database reloads after a successful run of the program. If the batch program does not save the database(e.g. reports) then there is no reason to reload database. dbids are refreshed.
| `noUnload` | If you set this to`t`, you don't save the database to disk. You use this for a program that creates a new database or doesn't require an Allegro PCB Editor database. Default is `nil`.
| `silent` | If you set this to`t`, no messages are displayed. Use when the user does not need to know that a program is spawned. Default is `nil`.
| `noProgress` | If`t`, the progress meter does not display. Default is `nil`.
| `noLogview` | When set, it prevents display if log file on program exit.
| `noWarnOnExit` | When set, suppresses some exit warning messages.
| `warnProgram` | Program supports warning status (returns 0, if success; 1, if warnings; and 2, if errors).
| `noExitMsgs` | When set, suppresses messages about program success or failure.
**Note:** For`t_cmdFmt`, the formatting should include everything except the design filename. Place a `%s` where the design should appear. To get a `%s` while doing a `sprintf`, use a "`%%s`" as shown in following examples:

`cmdFmt = "netrev -$ -q -r %s"`

`sprintf(cmdFmt, "%s -$ %s %s %%s", prog, argq argr)`

|
| ---
|
 **a.** | For debug, set the env variable,`wait_debug`, on the Allegro command line:
> > `set wait_debug`

> > or in Skill

> > `axlSetVariable("wait_debug" nil)`

> > This echos the spawning arguments of your program. You can also use this variable to see how Allegro spawns programs from its dialogs. The`"#T<num>.tmp"` name seen in this output is the temporary save of the current design to disk and the use of the `"%s"` argument in your `t_cmdFmt` statement.

|
| ---
|
 **b.** | For a list of Allegro programs and their command line arguments see the directory:
`<cdsroot>/share/pcb/batchhelp`

> > or run the batch program with the`"-help"` argument.

`Example: idf_in -help`

|
| ---
|
 **c.** | Many Allegro batch programs support`'-$'` as a standard argument. This prevents prompting for missing input arguments.
#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_prog` | string containing program name
| `t_cmdFmt` | string containing starting arguments (including program)
| `t_logfile` | optional string showing logfile
| `t_startMsg` | optional string having start message
| `?reloadDB` | Optional t/nil having database be reloaded after job completes
| `?noUnload` | Optional t/nil stating database shouldn't be saved
| `?silent` | Optional t/nil controlling info messages
| `?noProgress` | Optional t/nil controlling progress meter
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t` | Batch job ran.
| `x_error` | Error number that is program dependent on failure.

If you are using the IPC interfaces then you should call`axlSleep` instead of using `sleep`.

Arguments

`x_time` Time in seconds.

#### Value Returned

`t`All of the time.

### axlSort

`axlSort(t_infilet_outfile[t_sortfields][t_sort_options])⇒ t/nil`

#### Description

Sorts contents of a given input file and places results in the output file. No warning is given if the output file overwrites an existing file - any checking must be done by the caller of this function.

Default sort is a left to right, ASCII ascending sort of the input file, with duplicate lines left in. You can control the sort behavior using the optional parameters.

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_infile` | Name of the input file to sort.
| `t_outfile` | Name of the file containing results of the sort.
| `t_sortfields` | String specifying which fields to use as sort keys, the sort order of those fields, and how to interpret the data type of the field for sorting. String contains a series of triplets:  `field_number sortOrder fieldType`  String can contain multiple triplets separated by commas. Triplets can contain valid elements as shown:
|

* The third field, ascending, field type ASCII.

* The fifth field, descending, field type Integer.

* The first field, ascending, field type Float.

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_sort_options` | String containing directives controlling the global sort parameters. Sort options can appear in any order, and must be separated by commas. These options are available:
|  |
| --- | ---
| **Option** | **Description**

|  |
| --- | ---
| `alphalessp` sort | `U1 U10 U2`
| `axlStrcmpAlpNum` sort | `U1 U2 U10`
#### Arguments

|  |

`===> ("U1" "U2" "U5" "U5" "U10")`

### axlStringCSVParse

`axlStringCSVParse(t_string[g_stripWhite][t_separator]) -> lt_string/nil`

#### Description

Parses a comma delimited line (typical from Excel). This differs from the Skill prehistorian function in several areas which make it compatible with Excel csv file format:

* parseString ignores two adjacent commas.

* if a separator is contained within a cell, Excel quotes the cell.`parseString` treats this as two cells.

* Correctly processes double quotes in a cell.

#### Arguments

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_string` | A csv string
| `g_stripWhite` | Option to strip leading and trailing white space from each output string. Default is to leave whitespace. Do not advise using this option with separator set to " ".

> `-> ( "a" "b")`

* properly parse a csv file

> `ret = axlStringCSVParse("a,,c,\"d,e\"" )`

> `-> ( "a" "" "c" "d,e")`

* properly parse a csv file

> `ret = axlStringCSVParse("a||c|\"d|e\"" nil "|" )`

### axlStringRemoveSpaces

`axlStringRemoveSpaces(t_string) -> t_modString/nil`

`axlStringRemoveSpaces(lt_string) -> lt_modString/nil`

#### Description

This will strip leading or trailing whitespace from a string (standard C`ilspace()` macro). Has two modes:

* one string

* list of strings

In list of strings, items in list that are not a string are filtered out of the return.

#### Argument

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_string` | A string.
| `lt_string` | list of strings
#### Value Returned

|  |
| --- | ---
| `t_modString` | Modified string
